## Purpose

Load the India Paper Leaks dataset and understand its basic structure before further extraction, validation, cleaning and analysis.

## Required checks

- Display the complete dataset for an initial view.
- Display the first five and last five records.
- Check the number of rows and columns.
- Display the column names.
- Check the data types of all columns.
- Inspect the dataset information using `df.info()`.
- Generate basic descriptive statistics.
- Explore important categorical fields such as leak status, conducting body type, era and confidence.
- Select the columns required for the project analysis.
- Filter cases by leak status, conducting body type, era and confidence level.
- Identify records containing arrest and conviction information.

**Important:** The notebook uses the actual dataset loaded from the CSV file. The row and column counts are obtained from the loaded data rather than being hard-coded.
